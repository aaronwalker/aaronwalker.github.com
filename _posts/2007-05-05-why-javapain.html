So I created this blog for a couple of reasons mainly somewhere share my thoughts and ideas and maybe help avoid someone avoid some "JavaPain" in the process, hence the name of by blog.<br /><br />So hopefully this blog is going to be more than just an outlet for my frustrations although it's bound to happen :)<br /><br />I was at JavaOne 2007 last week (7 May to 11 May) and after taking to a few people about my ideas they all tended to ask what the address on my blog, which I then replied that I didn't have one. I always got a surprised look like I must be one of the only few people at JavaOne who didn't. It seemed everyone was blogged before sessions, during sessions and even at the pub.<br /><br />So over the next couple of weeks I will blog about my first JavaOne experience plus probably other random stuff.<br /><br />
