So it's been a busy year for me and for <a href="http://www.base2services.com/" title="base2 website">base2</a> and I really haven't done as much blogging as I should have but at least JavaOne gives me a good reason to.<p>So today I'm at <a href="http://www.startupcamp.org/">Startup Camp</a> which I think should be pretty interesting. There is about 3 to 4 hundred people here I wonder of all the startups in the room how many will make it.</p><p>Stay tuned to this channel...Well at least for the next week or so :)</p><p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos-c.ak.facebook.com/photos-ak-sf2p/v248/134/117/543017321/n543017321_572618_7011.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://photos-c.ak.facebook.com/photos-ak-sf2p/v248/134/117/543017321/n543017321_572618_7011.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a></p><p><br /></p><div class="blogger-post-footer">
